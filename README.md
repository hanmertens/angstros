# ÅngstrÖS

The *insert tagline here* operating system, currently for x86_64.

## Building and running

Use `cargo xtask` and its subcommands to use the build system. You may need to
copy and edit configuration files in the `config` directory.

## Inspiration

Based on the wonderful series [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com).

Inspiration from several (other) projects, such as:
- [bootloader (uefi branch)](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader/tree/uefi)
  for the basic UEFI stub structure.
